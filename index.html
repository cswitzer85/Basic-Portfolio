        My name is Cody Switzer, I'm married (Judy) and have an 18 month old son (Elliott).
        I was born in Denton, Texas and have lived in North Texas my entire life. I love to visit new places with my
        family, nationally and internationally.
        Whenever we're visiting a new place, I like to immerese myself into the culture and blend in (as best as I can)
        so that I can gain a better understanding of the people and what it's like to live there.
        I love to try new foods and attempt to recreate them back home. This has lead to hobbies such as dry aging beef,
        boiling crawfish and smoking meat.
        Food is a great way to find common ground with strangers, even if you don't have similar tastes you can learn
        from them and speak your mind about what drives your preferences. Oh... And I have 6 dogs.
