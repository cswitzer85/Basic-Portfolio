          Budding developer with problem solving and process optimization background, including more than 5 years of
          leadership. Academic achievements include President’s List, National Technical Honors Society, 3.4 GPA and
          recently earned Full Stack Development Certificate at Southern Methodist University. Workplace accolades
          include numerous MVP awards and “Member of the Year”. In my first year as Internal Assistant Service Manager
          at Park Place, I was able to build a relationship and collaborate with four separate teams to achieve a 30%
          reduction in cycle time for pre-owned vehicle reconditioning. By nature I am a focused, resilient and
          passionate perfectionist. As luck would have it those attributes align extremely well with programming. I find
          myself eager to learn how things work and rally my peers to bond and collaborate efficiently, while having
          fun! By leveraging technical expertise and emotional intelligence, I’m a unique contributor that adds value,
          efficiency and motivation to my team. <br> My hobbies include archery, auto racing, food, smoking/grilling, dry aging beef, carpentry, design, coffee,
          tea and now coding.
